# ZCP CLI Roadmap

Features planned, in progress, or blocked on platform support.

---

## Completed (v0.0.7)

- 42 commands covering VM, storage, networking, billing, monitoring, DNS, projects, support, and more
- Full VM lifecycle: create, start, stop, reboot, reset, tags, change-plan, change-OS, cancel
- VPC lifecycle: create, list, update, restart, ACL list create, VPN gateway create
- VPC tier/subnet creation via `POST /networks` with `type=Vpc`
- Bearer token authentication
- Global `--auto-approve` / `-y` flag for CI/CD automation
- All old STKBILL code removed, zero `/restapi/` references

---

## Planned for next patch

### CLI improvements (no platform dependency)

- [ ] `network create` — add `--vpc`, `--type`, `--gateway`, `--netmask`, `--acl-id` flags for VPC tier creation
- [ ] `network create` — add `--acl` flag that resolves ACL name to ID automatically
- [ ] `portforward create` — add `--public-end-port` and `--private-end-port` flags (API requires them)
- [ ] `instance change-hostname` — fix request body field name (`vm_label` instead of `label`)
- [ ] `region` command — add `use` subcommand to set default region in profile
- [ ] Default `--cloud-provider`, `--region`, `--project` from profile config to reduce flag repetition

### Blocked on STKCNSL platform

These features require API endpoints or fixes from the STKCNSL team.

#### Missing DELETE endpoints

The API has no DELETE for these resource types. Resources can only be removed via `billing cancel-service` for VMs/volumes, but not for networking resources.

- [ ] `DELETE /vpcs/{slug}` — VPC deletion
- [ ] `DELETE /networks/{slug}` — network deletion (isolated and VPC tiers)
- [ ] `DELETE /virtual-routers/{slug}` — virtual router deletion
- [ ] `DELETE /ipaddresses/{slug}` — IP address release
- [ ] `DELETE /vpcs/{slug}/network-acl-list/{id}` — ACL list deletion
- [ ] `billing cancel-service` for VPC/Virtual Router service type — currently returns "service not found"

#### Missing ACL rule CRUD

The UI has "Add Rule" with Number, CIDR, Action, Protocol, Traffic Type fields, but no public API endpoint exists for creating rules inside an ACL list.

- [ ] `POST /vpcs/{slug}/network-acl-list/{acl_id}/rules` — create ACL rule
- [ ] `DELETE /vpcs/{slug}/network-acl-list/{acl_id}/rules/{rule_id}` — delete ACL rule
- [ ] `GET /vpcs/{slug}/network-acl-list/{acl_id}/rules` — list ACL rules

#### Network create (isolated) — noida region

`POST /networks` returns `missing parameter networkofferingid` for the nimbo/noida region. The API doesn't expose the network offering field. Likely a region configuration issue.

- [ ] Network offering mapping for nimbo/noida

#### DNS provisioning

`POST /dns/domains` returns `cloud_provider_setup: DNS configuration required`. DNS needs admin-side provisioning.

- [ ] DNS enabled for our account/region

#### Network quota

Only 2 VPC tier networks allowed before quota exceeded.

- [ ] Quota increase for testing

---

## Future (v0.0.9+)

- [ ] Pagination support — `--page`, `--per-page` flags for list commands
- [ ] `--wait` flag on VPC create, volume create (poll until ready)
- [ ] JSON output improvements — consistent envelope stripping
- [ ] Shell completion for dynamic values (region slugs, plan slugs, etc.)
- [ ] `zcp config set` for default cloud-provider, region, project
- [ ] Object storage management (if API endpoint becomes available)
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster full lifecycle (create works, delete via billing cancel-service)
